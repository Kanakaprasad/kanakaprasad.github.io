                <h3>AWS Cloud Engineer at Carveniche Technologies</h3>
                <p>Hello! I'm Kanakaprasad SD, an AWS Cloud Engineer based in Bengaluru with 1.3 years of hands-on experience in designing, deploying, and optimizing cloud infrastructure.</p>
                
                <p>My expertise includes provisioning and managing EC2 instances, ensuring high availability with Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) and static Elastic IPs. I am skilled in Route 53 for domain and subdomain management, including SSL upgrades via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).</p>
                
                <p>Security and performance are at the core of my workâ€”I leverage AWS Security Hub, WAF, and CloudFront to enhance security and optimize content delivery. With hands-on experience in IAM policy management, Linux OS patching, and log management, I ensure robust system administration.</p>
                
                <p>I have built CI/CD pipelines from scratch, integrating Git for seamless deployments. Using AWS Amplify, I streamline web app hosting for scalability and performance. I also monitor infrastructure with New Relic and handle secure file transfers using WinSCP (SFTP/FTP).</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, I have foundational knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes, utilizing Docker CLI for container monitoring.</p>
